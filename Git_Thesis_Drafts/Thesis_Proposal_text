Statement of the Problem
This study aims to address how coral and sponge communities in the Caribbean change over time. If there is no relationship between the two communities’ temporal changes, this may indicate differential resilience to environmental factors. Statistical procedures, including model selection, will be applied.
Justification for and Significance of the Study
Ecological communities are changing and there has been an increase in rates of biodiversity loss (Staudinger et al., 2013; Stork, 2010). Declines in biodiversity have been associated with higher levels of disturbance that affect community dynamics and species extinction (Svensson et al., 2007). A disturbance is any temporally discrete event that disrupts inter- and intra-relationships by changing resource availability (Svensson et al., 2007). Historically, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been used to describe how competition and intermediate natural disturbances, such as hurricanes, maintain high species diversity in certain ecosystems, such as tropical forests and coral reefs (Connell, 1978). Now coral reef communities are threatened by anthropogenic disturbances that vary on spatial and temporal scales, such as dredging, ocean acidification, sedimentation, overfishing, and persistent high temperatures. Some of these disturbances have been found to affect richness, abundance, and diversity of reef organisms, as well as their functional roles within the ecosystem (Bell, 2008; Bellwood, Hughes, Folke, & Nyström, 2004; Habibi, Setiasih, & Sartin, 2007; Nelson et al., 2016; Stubler, Duckworth, & Peterson, 2015; J. L. Wulff, 2006). The high species diversity response to natural disturbance assumes coral reef communities can recover, but these additional anthropogenic factors that have compromised this resilience (Hughes et al., 2017).
One approach to study the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance is to focus on foundation species; organisms that take up much of an ecosystem’s surface area or volume and promote biodiversity through various functional roles (Angelini et al., 2018). Foundation species play important roles in establishing ecosystems and, in several marine ecosystems, have been attributed with maintaining biodiversity (Angelini, Altieri, Silliman, & Bertness, 2018). When ecosystems are threatened by disturbance the impacts of these disturbances on the foundation species may have consequences for the rest of the system. California mussels and seagrasses are examples of foundation species threatened by disturbances (Gaylord et al., 2011; Thomson, Burkholder, & Heithaus, 2015).
With increasing disturbance rates and declining biodiversity, much attention has been given to monitoring coral reefs around the world. Because corals provide the foundation for these ecosystems, many studies use coral diversity as a proxy for overall reef diversity (Darling et al., 2017; Stella, Pratchett, Hutchings, & Jones, 2011). It has also been suggested that sponges may be a coexisting foundational group for coral reefs (Angelini et al., 2018).
Several studies have found that coral diversity is positively correlated with fish diversity (Darling et al., 2017). Relationships between corals and other groups have been studied (Stella et al., 2011). However, there is still a lack of long-term studies of the relationships between coral diversity and diversity of other taxonomic groups. In particular, there has been a call for studies that compare coral diversity and sponge diversity because of their dominant presence, the lack of long-term studies that consider sponges, and the potential for sponges to outcompete or associate with corals under certain conditions (Bell, 2008; J. Wulff, 2001; J. L. Wulff, 2006).
Investigating whether there is a relationship between corals and sponges over time and space will provide evidence to researchers of whether or not coral dynamics are an adequate proxy for the dynamics of other taxonomic groups.
Methodology or Procedures
Data Collection
At 8 different locations around Guana Head Island in the British Virgin Islands, Forrester et al. (2015) recorded percent cover for 27 groups of corals at varying levels of taxonomic resolution. They used the linear point-intercept method and recorded the substrate or coral group every 0.25 m for 3 30-m transects at each site between June and August from 1992-2016. These point observations were converted to surface area estimates of percent cover (Ohlhorst, Liddell, Taylor, & Taylor, 1988). At the same sites, they also recorded counts for 58 groups of sponges at varying levels of taxonomic resolution. For this, they used the line intercept method for 3 30-m transects between June and August from 1993-1995, 2000-2003, and 2005-2016 (Forrester et al., 2015). For both datasets, transects were set up at a depth of approximately 10 m. In 2011, transects for the sponge counts were conducted by two observers (E. MacLean and L. Jarecki), but in all other years, there was one observer (L. Jarecki). A percent cover of zero implies there were no individuals of that coral group represented on that transect. The 8 primary sites are White Bay, Muskmelon, Pelican Ghut, Crab Cove, Grand Ghut, Bigelow, Guana Head, and Monkey Point. In years when the primary site was unavailable for logistical reasons, an alternate site was surveyed. These sites are White Bay-alt, Monkey Pt area, White Bay E, and Bigelow-south. The sites were all fringing reefs and the only apparent difference among sites was the increased exposure to waves at the two sites to the north of the island. There are no negative values and no missing values for these datasets, but not all sites were surveyed in a given year.
Data Analysis
For the analysis, I only included data from the 8 primary sites and reconciled data inconsistencies. All corals included in the analysis are live hard corals in the order Scleractinia. All database management was done in R (citation).
Due to taxonomic diversity and morphological similarities among corals and sponges, some of the groups recorded may be considered parataxonomic units (i.e., recognizable taxonomic units) (Krell, 2004). The main critiques of using this method of grouping are the falsifiability and the reproducibility of the groups. Because there was one year for which there are two observers, there is a potential to investigate the reproducibility of the groups. However, because some of the groups imply a level of taxonomic uncertainty, the concern of falsifiability is difficult to address. This concern may be overcome by only using in the analysis those groups containing a single species. Professionals working with other diverse invertebrate groups have faced similar challenges. A study investigating the richness of saproxylic beetles suggested adequate results when using only subsets of the specimens that consist of identifiable individuals (Sebek et al., 2012).
Because the diversity of functional groups has been shown to increase reef resilience (Nyström, 2006), species may be considered based on their functional role within the ecosystem. For sponges, the major functional roles consist of erosion, stabilization (accretion), bentho-pelagic coupling, and associations with other organisms (Bell, 2008). Although not understood as well as the others, bentho-pelagic coupling may have significant impacts on the microhabitats available in the reef because some sponges have pumping rates of two times their own volume of water per hour (Bell, 2008). Coral functional roles are determined by colony shape and structure and consist of massive, plate-like, busy, columnar, unattached, encrusting, staghorn, and bottlebrush (Bellwood et al., 2004).
The following variables may be calculated for each dataset. Abundance is the sum of counts across all groups. Richness is the number of groups present. Simpson’s diversity index gives the probability that two randomly selected individuals will belong to different groups (1 is maximum diversity; 0 is no diversity). Shannon evenness index gives the probability that all groups that are present will have the same frequency (1 is perfect evenness; 0 is perfect unevenness).
