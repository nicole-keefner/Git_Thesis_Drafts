Statement of the Problem
This study aims to contribute to the minimal knowledge of sponge community dynamics and investigate their spatial dominance and covariance between sponge and coral communities. Data collected from reef monitoring in the British Virgin Islands will be used.
Justification for and Significance of the Study
Biodiversity declines associated with higher levels of anthropogenic stress disrupt community dynamics (Staudinger et al., 2013; Stork, 2010). Historically, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been used to describe how competition and intermediate natural disturbances, such as hurricanes, maintain high species diversity in certain ecosystems, such as tropical rain forests and coral reefs (Connell, 1978). However, coral reef communities are now threatened by anthropogenic stressors that vary on spatial and temporal scales, including ocean acidification and persistent high temperatures, as well as dredging, sedimentation, and overfishing. The high species diversity response to natural disturbance proposed by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis assumes coral reef communities can recover from natural disturbances like hurricanes, but the cumulative impact of additional anthropogenic stressors has compromised this resilience (Hughes et al., 2017).
Anthropogenic stressors on coral reefs alter community dynamics of these ecosystems. Due to persistent high temperatures in Australian waters, four times more reefs experienced extreme bleaching (>60% bleached) in 2016 than in 2002 (Hughes et al., 2017). Overharvesting in Indonesian reefs has led to declines in populations of economically and ecologically important fishes and invertebrates, including giant clams, as well as a 10% decrease in live cover from 1997-2006 (Habibi, Setiasih, & Sartin, 2007). Increased sedimentation rates in Jamaica have led to a decrease in the volume of sponges in coral reefs (Stubler, Duckworth, & Peterson, 2015).
One approach to study the consequences of anthropogenic stress is to focus on foundation species; spatially dominant organisms that establish and maintain biodiversity by filling multiple functional roles (Angelini, Altieri, Silliman, & Bertness, 2018). Anthropogenic stressors that threaten foundation species can have drastic impacts on the community structure of marine ecosystems. For example, the dominant seagrass species, Amphibolis antarctica, declined due to persistent high temperatures in the waters of Shark Bay, Australia which, in turn, led to degradation of the seagrass ecosystems (Thomson, Burkholder, & Heithaus, 2015). In the space-limited tidal zones of California, the mussel, Mytilus californianus, experienced a decrease in larval shell strength as a result of ocean acidification which is expected to be linked to higher mortality rates and shifts in community dynamics (Gaylord et al., 2011).
Rather than a single foundation species, coral reefs have a foundation group composed of many species of coral. Corals are a foundation group because they are spatially dominant, are primarily responsible for establishing reefs, and maintain biodiversity on reefs by acting as a food source, forming a substrate on which other organisms may grow, and providing refuge from predators. Corallivores are fishes, echinoderms, gastropods, and other reef invertebrates specialized to consume corals (Rotjan & Lewis, 2008; Stella, Pratchett, Hutchings, & Jones, 2011). Corals provide a substrate on which algae and bacteria may grow, providing food for grazers, such as Diadema antillarum (Sammarco, 1980; Stella et al., 2011). Corals create refuges for fish and invertebrates by adding to the reef’s structural complexity (Darling et al., 2017; Nyström, 2006; Stella et al., 2011). The high diversity of functional roles filled by corals makes the reef more resilient to disturbance (Bellwood, Hughes, Folke, & Nyström, 2004; Nyström, 2006).
Although not given as much consideration as corals until recently, sponges are a coexisting foundation group for coral reefs (Angelini et al., 2018). Similarly to corals, they are spatially dominant, stabilize rubble for coral larvae to colonize, and maintain biodiversity by producing reef sediment, binding reefs together, and filtering nutrients in the water column. Sponges play a unique role in reef establishment by stabilizing carbonate rubble, so it becomes suitable for colonization by carbonate-secreting organisms that bind the rubble more permanently to the reef (J. L. Wulff, 1984). One of the major functional roles of sponges is the production of sediment by eroding the reef (Rützler, 1975). However, there are other sponges that have been shown to aid in binding the reef (J. L. Wulff & Buss, 1979). Sponges also filter nutrients and microscopic organisms in the water column (Maldonado, Ribes, & van Duyl, 2012) at rates that may be responsible for mitigating phytoplankton blooms in Florida Bay (Peterson, Chester, Jochem, & Fourqurean, 2006). Other than a census study that showed a decline in sponge diversity in Panama (J. L. Wulff, 2006), there is still a lack of studies that consider long-term sponge community dynamics (Bell, 2008; Bell et al., 2017; J. Wulff, 2001). However, the author of the census study calls for others to conduct long-term surveys in other areas to determine if the declines in sponge populations are widespread (J. L. Wulff, 2006).
In light of the effects of anthropogenic stress on coral reefs, the relationship between corals and sponges has been more carefully considered, but there has yet to be a comparison at the community level. As reef degradation has increased, the composition of these foundation groups has begun to change. Some propose the potential for sponges to maintain integrity of corals through association while others argue the potential for sponges to outcompete corals leading to a phase shift to sponge-dominated reefs (Bell, 2008; Bell, Davy, Jones, Taylor, & Webster, 2013).
In this study, I will quantify sponge community dynamics. I propose that within the foundation groups of corals and sponges, there are some recognizable taxonomic units (RTU’s) and functional groups that are more spatially dominant than others. I will investigate these differences in spatial dominance. Finally, I will examine whether coral and sponge communities co-vary, giving consideration to both RTU’s and functional groups.
Methodology or Procedures
Data Collection
At 8 different locations around Guana Head Island in the British Virgin Islands, divers recorded percent cover for 27 recognizable taxonomic units (RTU’s) of corals (Forrester et al., 2015). They used the linear point-intercept method and recorded the substrate or coral group every 0.25 m for 3 30-m transects at each site between June and August from 1992-2016. These point observations were converted to surface area estimates of percent cover (Ohlhorst, Liddell, Taylor, & Taylor, 1988). At the same sites, they also recorded counts for 58 RTU’s of sponges. They used the line intercept method for 3 30-m transects between June and August from 1993-1995, 2000-2003, and 2005-2016 (Forrester et al., 2015). For both datasets, transects were set up at a depth of approximately 10-m. In 2011, transects for the sponge counts were conducted by two observers (E. MacLean and L. Jarecki), but in all other years, there was one observer (L. Jarecki). A percent cover of zero implies there were no individuals of that coral group represented on that transect. The 8 primary sites are White Bay, Muskmelon, Pelican Ghut, Crab Cove, Grand Ghut, Bigelow, Guana Head, and Monkey Point. In years when the primary site was unavailable for logistical reasons, an alternate site was surveyed. These sites are White Bay-alt, Monkey Pt area, White Bay E, and Bigelow-south. The sites were all fringing reefs and the only apparent difference among sites was the increased exposure to waves at the two sites to the north of the island. There are no negative values and data regarding sponges was not collected in 1993 at Crab Cove or 2014 at Pelican Ghut.
All sponges and corals were identified to species in the field where possible. However, several of the RTU’s include more than one species: taxonomists reassigned taxa thought to be different species to the same species after the study began, taxonomists divided a single species into multiple after the study began; and field identification is impossible for some species because several species share morphological characteristics that make them indistinguishable from each other. For the former two cases, the lowest resolution RTU was used. For example, the coral Montastraea annularis was recognized to be three separate species (M. annularis, M. faveolata, and M. franksi) in 1994 (Weil & Knowlton, 1989), but because the study began in 1992, the aggregate group was used.
Data Analysis
For the analysis, I will include data from the 8 primary sites and reconcile data inconsistencies. All corals included in the analysis will be live hard corals in the order Scleractinia. All database management and analysis will be conducted in R (R Core Team, 2017).
Due to taxonomic diversity and morphological similarities among corals and sponges, some of the groups recorded may be considered recognizable taxonomic units (Ward & Stanley, 2004). RTU’s are used when detailed taxonomic surveys in the field are challenging (Sebek et al., 2012). One of the main critiques of using this method of grouping is the uncertain ability to reproduce the determined groups by multiple observers or across the time span of the study (Krell, 2004). Because this study has one year for which there are two observers, there is a potential to investigate the reproducibility of the groups. However, similar to how different spatial scales reveal various aspects of relationships (Wiens, 1989), something similar might be true for different levels of taxonomic resolution- a finer scale may expose detailed dynamics, but it does not invalidate the temporal dynamics at a broader scale. For the analysis, I assume that within group variation is smaller than the spatial and temporal variation.
Because the diversity of functional groups has been shown to increase reef resilience (Nyström, 2006), species may be considered based on their functional role within the ecosystem. For sponges, the major functional roles consist of erosion, stabilization (accretion), bentho-pelagic coupling, and associations with other organisms (Bell, 2008). Although not understood as well as the others, bentho-pelagic coupling may have significant impacts on the microhabitats available in the reef because some sponges have pumping rates of two times their own volume of water per hour (Bell, 2008). Coral functional roles are typically determined by colony shape and structure and consist of massive, plate-like, bushy, columnar, unattached, encrusting, staghorn, and bottlebrush (Bellwood et al., 2004). However, corals with different life history strategies have been shown to differ in their dominance on the reef (Bak & Engel, 1979).
The following variables may be calculated for each dataset. Abundance is the sum of counts across all groups. Richness is the number of groups present. Simpson’s diversity index gives the probability that two randomly selected individuals will belong to different groups (1 is maximum diversity; 0 is no diversity). Shannon evenness index gives the probability that all groups that are present will have the same frequency (1 is perfect evenness; 0 is perfect unevenness).
